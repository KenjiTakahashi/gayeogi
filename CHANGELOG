0.1:
-Initial release

#Pretty buggy, I don't think anyone will like to use it.

0.2:
-Fully working metal-archives.com
-Logs dialog where all actions go
-LOTS of smaller fixes, I don't even remember all of them

#Usable for metalheads :).

0.3:
-Fixed bug which caused duplicated entries in some cases.
-Slightly re-defined interface.
-'Ownage' statistics (green, yellow, red).
-First ('artists') table is properly filled and colored.
-Changed runtime behaviour: It will now refresh only local
files and then allow you to tap 'remote' to update from
internet databases.
-Fixed problems with non-ascii characters.
-Switching analog option is working (Just double-click or
ENTER the album you want).
-Catched incorrect page rendering on metal-archives.
It rendered link to an empty album-template. It only
heppened to me once, but who knows...
-Slashes ('/') are now replaces by spaces (' '). You won't
use them in dir names anyway, will you?
-Setup script.
-Windows-based fixes. (Yes, it runs on Windows now)
-Note: Local and Settings buttons do nothing so far,
stay calm for next release :).

#Still no discogs in this release, sorry.

0.3.1:
-Fixed bug when you had 'analog'='YES' and 'digital'='NO'
and then switching 'digital' switched 'analog' too.
-Added setup.nsi to source tarball.
-Fixed bug which prevented storing two releases with same
name and year. After update you'll need to tap brand-new
"update pre-0.4 db" button, because I needed to change
albums table primary key.
-When you have some directories that could not be parsed
it will leave them and let you know which ones they are,
instead of failing instantly. (Fixes #3080361)

0.4:
-Re-designed interface for new features.
-Windows: Files are stored in DataLocation now, also it
is determined using Qt interface instead of windll and
ctypes.
-Completely re-designed local.Filesystem module. It now
reads tags and also stores track names/numbers. It's
much slower, but directory pattern independent.
-Logs display in main window (yea, no more pop-ups on
errors ;). Also possibility to save logs to file.
-'Local' button is finally working :).
-User can specify directories/files to ignore during
db creation.
-At first run it's displaying "normal" Settings page,
no more "special-first-run-configuration-things".
-Introduced The Great'n'Mighty Band Sensor, to
automatically sense which band to choose, so the user
might just run'n'leave and things will get done.
-Discogs !should! be working, but it's sooooo poor
that I don't want to touch anymore, use at your own
risk.
-Ability to choose in what manner databases should
be searched.
-Ability to choose what kind of releases to search
for (metal-archives only, for now).

0.4.1:
-Fixed artists statistics computing.
-Fixed foreign characters display.
-Added more informational messages (it displays if
something has been added/removed or not).
-Confirmation dialog upon exiting if there are some
unsaved changes.
