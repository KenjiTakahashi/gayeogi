== INSTALL ==

=== REQUIRES ===

python>=2.6
PyQt>=4.x
BeautifulSoup>=3.0
threadpool>=1.2.5 (here: http://chrisarndt.de/projects/threadpool/)

Note: Windows installer provides all that
dependencies to you, don't bother getting
them separately (unless you want to build
from source, of course).

=== LINUX ===

Just type 'python setup.py install' while
in package main directory and you should
be set.

=== WINDOWS ===

You should have no problems with provided
installer (just few clicks ;). If you want
to build it on your own then... you're on
your own.

=== UPGRADE FROM 0.2 ===

You should recreate database, because there
were some non-compatible changes made. To do
this just remove:
$HOME/.config/fetcher/db.sqlite3 (on Linux),
Documents\fetcher\db.sqlite3 (on Windows)
and re-run the application.
Sorry about this, I hope it won't happen in
the future.
