== INSTALL ==

=== REQUIRES ===

python>=2.6
PyQt>=4.x
BeautifulSoup>=3.0
threadpool>=1.2.5 (here: http://chrisarndt.de/projects/threadpool/)

=== LINUX ===

Just type 'python setup.py install' while in
package main directory and you should be set.

=== UPGRADE FROM 0.2 ===

You should recreate database, because there were
some non-compatible changes made. To do this just
remove:
$HOME/.config/fetcher/db.sqlite3 (on Linux),
Documents\fetcher\db.sqlite3 (on Windows)
and re-run the application.
Sorry about this, I hope it won't happen in the
future.
